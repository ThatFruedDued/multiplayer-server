# Node.js Multiplayer Server
## Usage
This repository must be used in Node.js. First, replace the rsakey variable with your RSA public key. This secures the connection, preventing cheating easily. Then, have your client to connect to a Berkeley socket (using an environment such as [websocket-sharp](https://github.com/sta/websocket-sharp)) with the url of "ws://server.example.com" (of course, using your actual server URL). It will then recieve a base64 RSA encrypted string, which your client needs to decrypt using the corresponding private key. This will result in stringified JSON, which you can parse. Then, you need to store the AES key and initialization vector on your client (this will be sent as "AES" and "IV" in the JSON, base64 encoded, corresponding), and temporarily store the "VERIFY" code to send back (this will probably be deprecated soon, so you might want to hold off on using this repo until an upcoming update.) Then, you need to send back a base64 encoded and AES encrypted (from the JSON earlier) back to the server. You can include things like position in your response (this will start working soon, again, in an upcoming update.)

## TL;DR
Hold off until an upcoming update to use this repo.
